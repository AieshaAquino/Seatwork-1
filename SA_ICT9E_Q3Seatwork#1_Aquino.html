	<h2> Spider-No way home is based from the Marvel comics character, Spider-Man. Mysterio (Spider-man's enemy) exposed Spider-Man's Identity (Tom  Holland) as peter parker, a student. The world has gone crazy finding out spider-man's identity and accusing him of killing one of the mightiest heroes on earth. Doctor Strange, started helping Spider-man by casting a spell that would forget him as peter parker. Unfortunately, it didn't work. Because of this, other people started entering their world that came from other multiverse. <h2>
